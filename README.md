# ft_irc

## Installation

## Usage

```sh
./ircserv [host:port_network:password_network] <port> <password>
```

- `host`: the hostname on which IRC must connect to join a already existing network
- `port_network`: the server port on which IRC must connect on host
- `password_network`: the password needed to connect on host
- `port`: the port number on which your server will accept incoming connections
- `password`: the password needed by any IRC client that wants to connect to your server

If no `host`, `port_network` and `password_network` were given, a new IRC network is created.
